The Classic game of Rock, Paper, Scissors.


"Rock Paper Scissors is a classic hand game played between two players, where each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. 

The three shapes are 'rock,' 'paper,' and 'scissors.' The game follows a simple set of rules: rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, and paper beats rock. 


The players choose their shapes, and the winner is determined based on the rules. 


It's a game of chance and strategy, as players try to outwit their opponents and predict their next move. Rock Paper Scissors is a fun and quick game that can be enjoyed by people of all ages!"
